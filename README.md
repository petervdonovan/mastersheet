This repository, in combination with socscrapecontent, is part of a high school project to transfer data from Long Beach Unified School District (LBUSD) websites to Google Sheets, so that it will update dynamically based on edits to the spreadsheets. The code in this repository simply was used as a command-line application to generate the Excel spreadsheet that can then be uploaded as a link to several (11) other spreadsheets -- one containing separate information for each school in LBUSD.
